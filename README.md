# Fatal_Force

Part of the data visualisation course at Brunel Unviersity 2021, using Tableau to create a data visualisation on a selected topic.

Police violence in the U.S reached a boiling point last year with catacysmic events triggering global protests. 

In todays digital world of fake news and misinformation, my dashboard aimed to prove insights to users to understand just how disproportionately black men are at risk of being shot and killed by police and which states have the largest death rates.

Data was collected by the washington post and downloaded from: https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings

A second dataset containing the population distribution across each state was downloaded from: https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/distribution-by-raceethnicity/?dataView=0&currentTimeframe=4&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D

The final dashboard enabled dynamic filtering by year, race and state.
